Experimenting with TensorFlow - implement a simple convolutional
network for MNIST classification.

Includes two convolution / max-pooling layers, a fully connected
hidden layer and a softmax output layer. Uses L2 regularization
and a log-likelihood cost function. Parameters taken from Michael
Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Chapter 6.
